# Video Meeting

- Simple application. First the user creates a new account in the application using Firebase Auth (Sign Up), Second, user will log in to the application and We will store logged user information into shared preferences to handle auto-sign in so users don't need to enter email and password every time, and Final we display  list of registered users in the application except for the currently logged user because he cannot establish a call with himself.
